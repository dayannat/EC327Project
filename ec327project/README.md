## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

With that out of the way, here's my (Daniel Paganelli) notes on the current work.

1.) I don't know how to port this into git.

2.) I don't know how to get all the values into a database form. Working on putting it in XML.

3.) Because Java doesn't allow for the modifications of variables without using return, we won't be using the 'numberOfClasses' int we planned on using. Instead, we'll have to reference the size of the ArrayList classes.

5.) I have no idea in hell how to get this to link up with the front end.

6.) This is really dumb that we're not doing it in C++.
